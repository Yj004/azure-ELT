## Project Overview

This project establishes an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Azure and Databricks. The pipeline fetches raw data from various sources into Azure Blob Storage, where itâ€™s then processed, cleaned, and transformed in Databricks using Python and SQL. This pipeline architecture supports scalable and efficient data operations, suitable for complex data transformation and analysis tasks.

### Key Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Fetches data into Azure Blob Storage.
- **Data Processing and Transformation**: Utilizes Databricks for data cleaning and transformation.
- **Language Support**: Python and SQL for data manipulation.
- **Scalability**: Built to scale with large datasets.

## Architecture

The project architecture involves the following Azure components:
1. **Azure Blob Storage**: Centralized storage for raw data.
2. **Databricks**: Platform for data transformation and analysis using Python and SQL.
3. **Azure Data Factory (optional)**: For scheduling and orchestrating data workflows.

**Pipeline Flow**:
1. Data is fetched and ingested into Azure Blob Storage.
2. Databricks processes data for cleaning and transformation.
3. Transformed data is stored for further analytics or applications.

## Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Data is sourced from various APIs or databases and moved to Azure Blob Storage.
2. **Data Transformation**: In Databricks, data is cleaned and transformed using Python and SQL.
3. **Storage and Output**: The transformed data is stored in Azure Blob Storage or other data sinks for downstream applications or analysis.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Azure Account
- Databricks Workspace
- Python 3.x

### Steps
1. **Set up Azure Blob Storage**: 
   - Create a storage account and a container to store the raw data.
2. **Configure Databricks**:
   - Set up a Databricks workspace and a cluster.
   - Install necessary libraries (`pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, etc.).
3. **Connect Azure Blob Storage to Databricks**:
   - Generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) for secure access.
4. **Write Data Ingestion Script**:
   - Script to fetch data into Azure Blob Storage.
5. **Data Transformation in Databricks**:
   - Use notebooks to clean and transform data using Python and SQL.

## Usage

1. **Ingest Data**:
   - Run the ingestion script to pull data into Azure Blob Storage.
2. **Transform Data in Databricks**:
   - Open Databricks, load the notebook, and run cells to transform the data.
3. **Export Transformed Data**:
   - Store the processed data for further use.
